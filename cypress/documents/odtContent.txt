Test Plan
for the
File Difference Application

1. Objectives
1.1 Purpose
This document describes the plan for testing the File Difference application.
This Test Plan document supports the following objectives:
    • Identify the resources needed for testing manual and automated
    • Recommend and describe the testing strategies 

	
2. Resources needed for testing
    • The application must be tested for the following browsers: Firefox, Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, Opera
    • Automated test cases will be written in Java (at least Java 8), and the framework used is Selenium.
    • Continuous integration tool: Jenkins
      

3. Testing Strategy
3.1 Performance testing 
    • Test the application loading time for different size documents
    • Test the resource usage of the application when loading uploading/compare different size documents
                           Undesired behavior for performance testing: the application crashes while uploading or comparing the documents
                          

3.2 Load testing 
    • Test the application behavior when multiple users try to upload a document (5MB)
    • Test the application behavior when multiple users try to compare a document (at least 5MB)
                           Undesired behavior for load testing: the application crashes while uploading or comparing the documents

3.3 Stress testing 
    • Test the application behavior when multiple users try to upload and compare a document of small size (5MB) for one hour 
                          Undesired behavior for stress testing: the application crashes while uploading or comparing the documents
      
3.4 Automated Regression Testing
    • Test cases will be run in after every release to ensure that the existing functionality works fine
                          Undesired behavior for regression testing: the application crashes while uploading or comparing the documents, buttons cannot be pressed anymore, etc.

4. User Acceptance Criteria
    • All buttons on the application must work
    • Uploading documents must work without crashing
    • Comparing documents must work without crashing

5. Test Plan
    1. Upload the same document for comparing and check the result (at least 1Mb max 10Mb) => there should be no differences
    2. Upload two diffrent documents for comparing and check the result (at least 1Mb max 10Mb) => the app should show the differences
    3. Upload only one document and compare with nothing => the app should request the other document for comparing
